            <h1 class="story-title">THE JEW'S GRAVE</h1>
            <p class="story-author">by Ricarda Huch<br>Translated by Terra Laggner</p>

            <div class="story-text">
                <p>In Jeddam there was only one Jew, who had ended up there in the following manner: His wife, to whom he was bound by the truest love, was a native of Jeddam, and when her father died leaving behind considerable property, it was desirable that she go there in person to settle her inheritance. With the prospect of seeing her childhood home again, homesickness awakened in her, and the family, which consisted of father, mother, and two barely grown children, undertook the long journey. Now, since the town of Jeddam, with more of a village character than an urban one, lay so defiantly and charmingly among moderately high mountains, rich grain fields, and green meadows watered by the little river Melk, and since the wife felt so at home in her familiar childhood surroundings, her good-natured husband agreed to relocate entirely. Of course, he could not think of managing his wife's large estate himself, so he hired a young manager for that purpose, while he himself opened a shop in town of the kind he had operated before. Since there had been no such shop in Jeddam previously and purchases had been made in the nearest larger city, the business could have flourished, had the proprietor not been a Jew, a people the inhabitants of Jeddam wanted absolutely nothing to do with. Enough was sold, to be sure, but little was paid, and when Mr. Samuel tried to sue for the outstanding debts, he had to learn that the authorities would not take up his case and he would at most have to pay court costs without being able to get his obvious due. It often worried him what would become of this, and he would have gladly gone off with his family if he had known how to get his money in this hostile environment and sell his wife's property without too great a loss.</p>

                <p>This went on for a number of years, until one day Mr. Samuel became ill and sent for the doctor in the nearest small town. When, after his second request to come quickly (for the first had had no success whatsoever), he received the answer that the doctor was very busy and regretted that he could not comply with the summons, he felt uneasy, and for the first time seriously considered how he might die miserably and perish here. While the family sat around his bed full of worry and consultation, he said, "The best thing would be, since I'm sick anyway, if I died, then you could live here unmolested and be happy." His wife Rosette and the two children, Anitza and Emanuel, reproached him for talking that way, since they could not be happy even in Paradise without him, and Mr. Ive, the manager, who was Anitza's fiancé, said that it was also incorrect because the inhabitants of Jeddam would tolerate the apostate woman who had married a Jew, and his children, as little among them as himself.</p>

                <p>"But what if," said Anitza, "we declared you dead, Father, and buried you, while you secretly returned to your homeland, and Ive, as our natural friend and guardian, settled our affairs and then brought us to you?"</p>

                <p>Mr. Samuel at first wanted nothing to do with such schemes, but since the manager declared that he thought he could bring the matter to a good end, and since wife and children were full of eagerness and impatience for the adventure, by means of which the people of Jeddam would also be played a trick, he finally agreed to put it into action. Scarcely had he recovered somewhat when he left Jeddam by night. He succeeded in reaching the next larger town on the coast unnoticed, where he took ship.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Rosette and Anitza, with Mr. Ive's help, stuffed a neat dummy, attached a suitable mask with a beard of horsehair in front of the straw head, and laid this figure, dressed in a clean shroud, on Mr. Samuel's bed. They covered the mask with a handkerchief, but the wax hands, which they had adorned with the beautiful diamond ring that Samuel used to wear on his index finger for the sake of authenticity and resemblance, remained visible. The fraud would probably have been discovered anyway, if the Jew's house had not been avoided like that of a leper. When the news of his death was spread abroad, there was no lack of curious onlookers, but they restrained themselves and peered from a distance, so that only their own servants timidly viewed the artificial corpse from the threshold.</p>

                <p>Next, Mr. Ive went to the town council to report Mr. Samuel's death and arrange for the burial, but was referred there to the priest, who was supposed to handle these matters. The priest was a man with thick, curly hair and a short, wooden forehead above a broad face, usually silent, not from inclination or disposition, but because he had nothing to say. His large eyes flickered anxiously and troubled before the great emptiness of his skull, and on the whole he was more a helplessly sad and harmless man than a malicious one, except when it came to certain church matters. As soon as any matter came up in which he had his opinion, however misguided it might be, and in which he was at all authoritative, he seized upon it with vehemence, puffed himself up, and spat poison at everyone who came near him, in the unconscious urge to avenge himself for their having so often seen him standing uselessly in the corner as an insignificant, dim-witted oaf. When Mr. Ive announced himself, the priest already knew what it was about, and received him with the words: "What is it, Mr. Ive? Something tremendous must be afoot for you to come to me! You don't tend to overwhelm me, neither in my house nor in the house of God! These people have no need of pastoral care, but now I suppose it concerns an inheritance or a marriage, where they're always ready at hand!"</p>
