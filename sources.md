# Sources and Citation TODO

Purpose: track claims that may require stronger sourcing before marketing amplification.

## Priority claims to verify with publishable citations

1. Ricarda Huch reception in German literary institutions and critical histories.
2. Specific recognition claims (for example, reported nominations/consideration in major awards contexts).
3. Statements about first-time English availability for specific texts/translations.
4. Historical timeline details used in public-facing bios.

## Current editorial policy on this site

- Use wording such as "reported nominations" or "reported consideration" unless primary evidence is included in this repository.
- Prefer transparent framing over overstated certainty.
- Update article language once source quality improves.

## Next documentation step

Add a `references/` folder with:
- bibliographic notes,
- page-level citations,
- and a short provenance note for each factual claim used in marketing copy.
