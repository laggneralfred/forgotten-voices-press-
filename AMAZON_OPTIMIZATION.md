# Amazon KDP Optimization Guide

## Overview

Amazon's algorithm rewards books that:

2. Convert clicks into purchases
3. Get reviews quickly after launch
4. Keep readers engaged (completion rate for ebooks)

This guide will help you optimize every element of your Amazon listing to maximize visibility and sales.

## Part 1: Book Description (The Most Important Element)

Your book description is a sales page, not a summary. It needs to:
- Hook browsers in the first 2 sentences
- Make readers care about Ricarda Huch
- Give enough detail to understand what they're buying
- Create urgency or desire to read NOW

### Description Structure

**Line 1-2: The Hook (appears above "Read More")**
This is all most browsers will see. Make it count.

**Good examples:**
- "In 1905, a woman Thomas Mann called 'Germany's first lady of letters' wrote three satirical novellas that skewered high society. Then the world forgot her."
- "Ricarda Huch was nominated for the Nobel Prize, praised by Stefan Zweig, and admired by Hermann Hesse. You've probably never heard of her."

**Bad examples:**
- "This is a collection of three novellas by German author Ricarda Huch."
- "Soap Bubbles contains three stories about life in early 20th century Germany."

**The First Section: Why This Book Matters (2-3 short paragraphs)**
Establish stakes and significance.

**The Second Section: What's Inside (Bullet points work great)**
Summarize the three novellas briefly.

**The Third Section: About the Author**
Build credibility and create connection.

**The Final Section: Call to Action**
Gentle nudge to scroll up and buy.

### Complete Book Description Template

Copy this structure and customize:

```
In 1905, a woman Thomas Mann called "Germany's first lady of letters" wrote three satirical novellas that exposed the absurdities of European high society. Then the world forgot her.

Ricarda Huch was the first woman admitted to the Prussian Academy of Arts, a historian whose work is still studied today, and a novelist whose psychological insight anticipated Virginia Woolf. She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Yet outside Germany, she's virtually unknown.

Until now.

---

<b>SOAP BUBBLES: THREE SATIRICAL NOVELLAS</b>

<b>The Governess</b> – A young woman enters domestic service in a wealthy household and discovers that manners, money, and morals don't always align. Sharp-eyed, witty, and psychologically astute.

<b>The House of Colardi</b> – An eccentric artistic family in bohemian Munich navigates love, ambition, and the price of living outside convention. A portrait of the artist as a bundle of contradictions.

<b>The Last Summer</b> – A woman at a crossroads realizes the limitations society has placed on her life—and decides whether to accept them. Bittersweet, insightful, and quietly revolutionary.

---

<b>Why Read This Translation?</b>

This isn't a quick machine translation. It's a literary restoration project: 200+ hours of careful editing to preserve Huch's wit, voice, and psychological depth while making her work flow naturally in English.

If you love classic European fiction, forgotten literary voices, or witty social satire—this is for you.

---

<b>About Ricarda Huch (1864-1947)</b>

Ricarda Huch earned a doctorate when German universities wouldn't admit women. She wrote novels, poetry, history, and criticism. She resigned from the Prussian Academy in 1933 to protest Nazi cultural policies. Thomas Mann called her work "magnificent." Hermann Hesse praised her "intellectual independence."

She deserves to be rediscovered.

---

<b>Praise for Ricarda Huch:</b>

"Ricarda Huch is one of the most significant writers of the German language."

"Her historical works are masterpieces of narrative art."
—<i>Thomas Mann</i>

```

**Formatting Notes:**
- Use `<b>` for bold (Amazon doesn't support markdown)
- Use `<i>` for italics
- Use `<br>` for line breaks if needed
- Keep paragraphs SHORT (2-3 sentences max)
- Use white space generously

---

## Part 2: Title and Subtitle

### Title: Keep It Simple
**Main title:** Soap Bubbles

**Don't overthink it.** Readers search for author names and themes, not creative title variations.

### Subtitle: This Is Your SEO Weapon

Your subtitle should include:
1. Genre/format descriptor
2. Key search terms
3. Author's name (if not in main title)

**Good subtitle options:**
- "Three Satirical Novellas by Ricarda Huch"
- "Satirical Novellas from Germany's Forgotten First Lady of Letters"
- "A Rediscovered Classic of German Literature"

**What to include:**
- Genre keywords (novellas, satire, classic)
- Geographic/cultural keywords (German, European)
- Discovery language (rediscovered, forgotten, lost)

**Amazon title format:**
```
Soap Bubbles: Three Satirical Novellas by Ricarda Huch (Forgotten Voices Press)
```

## Part 3: Categories (Choose Wisely)

You can select **2 categories** when you upload, but you can get up to **10 total** by:
1. Selecting 2 in KDP dashboard
2. Emailing KDP support to add up to 8 more

### Recommended Categories:

**Primary Categories (Select These First):**
1. **Books > Literature & Fiction > Classics**

6. **Books > Literature & Fiction > History & Criticism > Books & Reading > General**
7. **Kindle Store > Kindle eBooks > Literature & Fiction > Literary Fiction**
8. **Books > Biographies & Memoirs > Historical > Europe > Germany**

## Part 4: Keywords (The 7 Magic Phrases)

Amazon gives you 7 keyword slots. Use them strategically.

**Don't waste keywords on:**
- Words already in your title/subtitle (Amazon indexes those automatically)
- Single words ("German" - too broad)
- Your author name (already indexed)

**Do use keywords for:**
- Comp authors (similar writers)
- Specific subgenres
- Reader intent phrases
- Related themes

### Recommended Keywords:

1. **women writers forgotten voices**
   - Targets readers searching for underrepresented authors

2. **classic German literature translation**
   - Captures genre + language + format

3. **turn of the century European fiction**
   - Historical period specificity

4. **social satire comedy of manners**
   - Genre and style descriptors

5. **literary fiction historical women**
   - Broad appeal + specific theme

6. **Stefan Zweig Hermann Hesse readers**
   - Comp authors (readers of similar German classics)

7. **forgotten classics rediscovered books**
   - Discovery/curation language

**Keyword Research Tools:**
- Amazon search autocomplete (start typing and see suggestions)
- Publisher Rocket ($97 one-time, worth it if you're serious)
- Helium 10 (Chrome extension for Amazon keyword research)

**Pro tip:** Search for successful comp books on Amazon and see what categories they're in. That's where your readers are browsing.

## Part 5: Book Cover Design

Your cover needs to:
1. Look professional (not DIY)
2. Be readable as a thumbnail (80% of views are mobile)
3. Signal "literary fiction" or "classic literature"
4. Stand out in search results

### Cover Elements:

**Option A: Classic Literature Look**
- Ornate border or decorative elements
- Serif font for title
- Muted, sophisticated color palette (cream, burgundy, forest green)
- Author name prominent (Ricarda Huch)
- Subtitle: "Translated by Alfred [Last Name]"

**Option B: Modern Rediscovery Look**
- Bold, contemporary typography
- Vintage illustration or photo (public domain)
- High contrast
- "Rediscovered Classic" or similar badge
- Clean, minimal design

**Text hierarchy:**
1. Author name: Ricarda Huch (largest)
2. Title: Soap Bubbles (second largest)
3. Subtitle/descriptor: Three Satirical Novellas (smaller)
4. Translator credit: Translated by Alfred [Name] (smallest, but present)

**Where to get covers:**
- **Fiverr:** $50-150, find designers with "book cover" in portfolio
- **Reedsy:** $200-500, professional book cover designers
- **99designs:** $299-499, run a contest and get multiple options
- **DIY with Canva:** Possible but risky (hard to look professional)

**Test your cover:**
- Shrink to thumbnail size (100x150px) - can you still read the title?
- Put next to comp titles on Amazon - does it fit the genre?
- Show to 5 readers in your target audience - would they click?

---

## Part 6: Pricing Strategy

### Ebook Pricing

**Launch pricing (Week 1):**
- **$2.99-4.99** – Special launch discount
- Gets momentum, early reviews, and visibility

**Regular pricing (After Week 1):**
- **$7.99-9.99** – Standard for literary fiction/classics
- Signals quality and premium positioning

**Royalty tiers:**
- **$0.99-2.98:** 35% royalty
- **$2.99-9.99:** 70% royalty (ALWAYS price in this range if possible)
- **$10.00+:** 35% royalty

**Math at $7.99:**
- 70% royalty = $5.59 per sale (minus delivery fees ~$0.15)
- Net: ~$5.44 per ebook sale

### Paperback Pricing

**KDP Print calculates minimum price based on page count.**

For a ~300-page book (estimated):
- Printing cost: ~$4.50
- Amazon's cut: 40% of list price
- Your royalty: 60% of (list price - printing cost)

**Recommended paperback price: $14.99-16.99**

**Math at $14.99:**
- Printing cost: $4.50
- Amazon's 40% cut: $5.99
- Your net: $14.99 - $4.50 - $5.99 = $4.50 per sale

**Math at $16.99:**
- Your net: $16.99 - $4.50 - $6.79 = $5.70 per sale

**Target: Price paperback 2-3x higher than ebook**
- Most sales will be ebook
- Paperback is for collectors, libraries, and gift-givers
- Higher price signals quality

---

## Part 7: Amazon A+ Content (Brand Registry Required)

A+ Content lets you add:
- Custom formatted book description
- Images, comparison charts, author bio
- Multi-column layouts

**Worth it?** Maybe, but not critical for launch.

**Requirements:**
- Must enroll in Amazon Brand Registry (requires trademark)
- Takes 2-3 months to set up
- Benefits are marginal for single-book publishers

**Recommendation:** Skip A+ Content for first book. Focus on nailing the basic listing first.

---

## Part 8: Amazon Ads (After Launch)

Once your book is live and has 5-10 reviews, consider Amazon Ads.

### When to Start Advertising:
- After you have at least 5 reviews (preferably 10+)
- After your book description is optimized
- After you have a professional cover
- When you have budget for at least $5-10/day for 30 days

### Amazon Ad Types:

**1. Sponsored Products (Start Here)**
- Shows your book in search results
- Cost-per-click (CPC): $0.30-0.60 average
- Target keywords like "classic German literature"

**2. Sponsored Brands**
- Shows your brand/publisher name with multiple books
- Only useful if you have 3+ books

**3. Lockscreen Ads**
- Shows on Kindle device lockscreens
- Lower CPC but less targeted

### Simple Amazon Ads Strategy:

**Campaign 1: Keyword Targeting**
- Target your 7 keywords plus variations
- Bid: $0.40-0.50
- Budget: $5/day
- Goal: ACOS (Advertising Cost of Sale) under 60%

**Campaign 2: Product Targeting**
- Target comp books (Stefan Zweig, Hermann Hesse, Edith Wharton)
- Bid: $0.50-0.60
- Budget: $5/day

**Track your ACOS:**
ACOS = Ad Spend ÷ Sales
- Under 40%: Great (very profitable)
- 40-60%: Good (break-even to profitable)
- Over 60%: Pause and optimize

**Resources:**
- Dave Chesson's "Publisher Rocket" course (free on YouTube)
- Bryan Cohen's "Amazon Ads for Authors" course
- KDP Ads dashboard has built-in suggestions

---

## Part 9: Reviews Strategy

Amazon's algorithm LOVES reviews. Here's how to get them ethically:

### Before Launch:

**1. ARC Readers (Advance Review Copies)**
- Email your list: "Want to read Soap Bubbles early in exchange for an honest review?"
- Send free copies 2-3 weeks before launch
- Ask them to post reviews on launch day
- Goal: 5-10 reviews on day 1

**2. Book Blogger Outreach**
- Find bloggers who review classic literature, translations, or women writers
- Email personalized pitches
- Offer free review copy
- Timeline: 2-3 months before launch (bloggers are slow)

**3. NetGalley (Optional, $450)**
- Platform where reviewers request free books
- Good for reaching librarians and professional reviewers
- Expensive but can generate 20-50 reviews
- Worth it if you're serious about this as a business

### After Launch:

**4. Email Your List**
- 2 weeks after launch: "Finished reading? Leave a review!"
- Include direct link to review page
- Make it easy (most readers want to help but forget)

**5. Goodreads Giveaway**
- Give away 5-10 print copies
- Generates visibility and reviews
- Free via Amazon (integrated with KDP)

### What NOT to Do:

❌ Buy reviews (Amazon will ban you)
❌ Trade reviews with other authors (against Amazon TOS)
❌ Pressure reviewers for positive reviews
❌ Review your own book (obviously)
❌ Have family/friends leave glowing 5-star reviews from their regular accounts (Amazon can detect this)

### Review Velocity Matters:

Amazon's algorithm prioritizes:
- **10 reviews in first 30 days** > 50 reviews over 6 months
- Getting reviews quickly signals reader engagement
- Aim for 10 reviews in Week 1, 25 reviews in Month 1

---

## Part 10: Launch Week Strategy

The first 7 days are CRITICAL. Amazon's algorithm watches for momentum.

### Day 1 (Launch Day):

**Morning:**
- Publish book (if not already live)
- Verify listing looks perfect (cover, description, price)
- Email your list with launch announcement (Email #4)
- Post on social media (if you use it)

**Afternoon:**
- Share in relevant Facebook groups (book groups, German literature groups, translation groups)
- Post on Goodreads
- Email friends/family with Amazon link

**Goal:** 10-20 sales on Day 1

### Days 2-3:

- Post in more niche communities (Reddit r/books, r/literature, r/suggestmeabook - follow each sub's self-promotion rules)
- Share on Twitter/X with relevant hashtags (#ForgottenBooks #GermanLiterature #WomenWriters)
- Reach out to book bloggers you contacted earlier

**Goal:** 5-10 sales per day

### Days 4-7:

- Email reminder to list (those who didn't click first email)
- Post updates ("10 reviews in first week!" builds social proof)
- Request reviews from early buyers
- Monitor Amazon ads (if running)

**Goal:** Consistent daily sales (even 2-3/day maintains momentum)

### Week 1 Targets:

- **50-100 sales** (ebook + print combined)
- **10+ reviews**
- **Hit "bestseller" badge in at least one niche category**

**Why Week 1 matters:**
- Amazon's algorithm gives new books a visibility boost
- Reviews and sales velocity determine if that boost continues
- "Bestseller" badge (even in a small category) creates social proof

---

## Part 11: Beyond Amazon

Don't limit yourself to Amazon only.

### Other Platforms:

**Draft2Digital** (distribute to multiple retailers):
- Apple Books
- Barnes & Noble
- Kobo
- Google Play Books
- Library platforms (Overdrive, Hoopla)

**Why wider distribution?**
- Apple Books readers tend to buy literary fiction
- Libraries buy DRM-free versions for lending
- International markets (Kobo is huge in Canada, Europe)
- More revenue streams

**When to go wide:**
- After your Amazon launch stabilizes (3-6 months)
- When you have reviews and social proof
- When you have multiple books (better ROI)

### Direct Sales (Advanced):

**Sell ebooks directly from your website using:**
- Gumroad ($10/month + fees)
- BookFunnel (author-focused platform)
- Payhip (no monthly fee, just transaction fees)

**Benefits:**
- Keep 90-95% of revenue (vs. 70% on Amazon)
- Build your own customer list
- No platform dependency

**Drawbacks:**
- You handle customer service
- No Amazon discoverability algorithm
- Sales tax compliance is YOUR problem

**Recommendation:** Start with Amazon KDP. Go wide after you have momentum.

## Part 12: Long-Term Optimization

### Month 1:
- Monitor sales and reviews daily
- Respond to all reviews (thank positive ones, learn from critical ones)
- Tweak book description if conversion rate is low
- Test different keywords

### Month 2-3:
- Experiment with pricing ($9.99 vs. $7.99 vs. $5.99)
- A/B test book description variations
- Start planning Book #2 (series momentum is powerful)

### Month 6:
- Evaluate: Is Amazon Ads profitable?
- Consider going wide (Draft2Digital)
- Plan a promotion or sale to reignite sales

### Year 1:
- Publish 2-3 more books in Forgotten Voices Press series
- Build your email list to 500+ subscribers
- Establish reputation as curator of forgotten German literature

## Final Thoughts
